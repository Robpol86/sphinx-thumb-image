==================
Sphinx Thumb Image
==================

Resize images in Sphinx documents/pages to thumbnails.

The purpose of this extension is to save on web storage costs and bandwidth fees, including data rates your visitors may
incur from image-heavy documentation. If the fullsize image is not referenced by another image directive it won't be copied
into your build's output directory.

``sphinx-thumb-image`` provides a ``thumb-image`` directive similar to the built in ``image`` directive. Set the thumbnail
size using the ``:resize-width:`` and/or ``:resize-height:`` options.
